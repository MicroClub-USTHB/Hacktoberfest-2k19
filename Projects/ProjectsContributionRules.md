##### INSTRUCTOIONS:
* Upload your projects inside a dedicated folder (e.g: _/Projects/JavaScripte/**my-javascript-game/**_
* If you don't find a proper folder for your type of project, then you're free to make one. (e.g:_/Projects/**JavaScripte/my-javascript-game/**_
* Upload your projects source files (_avoid compressed format .zip .rar or else_).
